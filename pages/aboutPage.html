				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>I'm Rury Gonzalez and I'm a creator. Most of my work so far has been in the realm of coding (including the whole front-end of this website), but most recently, I have concentrated my efforts in my art - mostly music and shooting film. Feel free to browse through my projects page to see what I've created over the years. Cheers!</p>
